      <h2>Application Form Options</h2>
    </div>
      <h4>Important!</h4>

        <p>
          Some schools have their own application forum and do not accept
          any of the following, therefore students must check with their
          college to know what they accept.
        </p>

    <ul>

      <div class="together">
      <div class="sechead">
        <li><h3>Common App</h3></li>
      </div>


        <p>
          The most common application form colleges accept. Once an account is created,
          students have access to their application up until they submit it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="together">
      <div class="sechead">
        <li><h3>Coalition App</h3></li>
      </div>

        <p>
          Students have the option to fill out the coalition app rather
          than the common app if their college offers the coalition app
          as a valid application form.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="together">
      <div class="sechead">
        <li><h3>Universal App</h3></li>
      </div>

        <p>Another type of application method with essay sections. Limitations include the number
        of schools that employ this application type.</p>

        <li><h3>Personal Statement</h3></li>
      </div>
      <ul>
          <li>If a student chooses to use the common app as their prefered application form,
            the personal statement is the most important essay.</li>
          <li>This essay will be sent to all the colleges a student decides to apply to.</li>
          <li>In this essay students are advised to relay a true narrative about an experience that
            had an impact on their life today.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><h3>Supplements</h3></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Some schools require students to provide addition information through shorter essays.</li>
        <li>Students are advised to complete supplements even if they are optional because colleges want
          to know as much about their prospective class.</li>
        <li>Students are also advised to not only write about new experiences they've had but also
          how they've changed or what they've learned through those experiences in the supplements.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>


    <div class="revs">
      <h2>Activities</h2>
    </div>
      <p>In this section, students are advised to expound on any activity they participated on
        in high school.</p>

        <h4>Important!</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Extraciriculars that students attained leadership positions in should be listed first
              and students shoul briefly explain the impact they had in that club.</li>
            <li>Students should be careful not to add activites they did not hold membership in high school
              or actvities they did not hold much interest in into their application.</li>
          </ul>
