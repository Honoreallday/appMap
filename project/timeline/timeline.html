      <hr>
      <p>Its time to figure out where you want to apply! And even though this may be one of the easier steps, It is easily on of the most important. So make sure
        to take it seriously, and be true to yourself
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you have a good proportion of safeties to schools that you think will be a reach</li>
          <li>Don't be scared to reach out to admissions and ask what they're school has to offer and what they want in students (it may give you a leg up)</li>
          <li>Try out the College board's searching system as a starting point, and branch out from there: <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search">Link.</a></li>

      <h3>Early action/desicion</h3>
      <hr>
      <p> Early action and decision can be a huge deal for some of you, and for others it won't be. EA and ED are when schools will allow you to apply to an earlier deadline
        and recieve an early decision. Just no that ED is binding in that if your accepted you are required to attend (a good way to apply to your dream school).
        <ul>
          <li>For those applying ED, you'll be on an expidited track trying to fill out your application because the deadline is usually november first. So in your case, it's
              likely best if you start that application (you are only allowed to do one ED app, since if your accepted, you'll be enrolled) as soon as it becomes available </li>
          <li>For anyone doing EA, you will also be on an expidited track. EA and ED are completley the same in most respects, the big difference being that it's non binding.</li>
          <li>Deciding to apply some where ED or EA is an big decision to make, but just know that you do not have to if you don't want to. There are defenitly benefits to doing so
            (earlier notification, higher acceptance rate) you don;t lose very much if it's something that youd ont decide to persue.</li>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <hr>
      <p id='w'> Recommendations can make the difference in a lot of your application, so it's very important ot pick the right teachers, and to give them lots of time to do it right.
        <ul id='w'>
          <li>
            If you already know who you'll be asking, try and reach out to them in the beggining of the year and get it over with quick, because once the school year gets going and there
            getting bombarded by requests from other students, they might not have the "creative juice" left to depict you in all of your awesomeness.</li>
          <li> And this one may be a no-brainer, but pick a the teachers that will make you look the best, that may not be the one your closest with (or the one you like the most). Just try
            and pick the person that understands you best as a student and a learner. Because those often make for the best references.</li>

              <li>All the EA/ED apps should have been turned in, so your only focus should be wrapping up everything you have left. From essay touch-ups, to re-reading all of your "short answer" answers. You want to

        Also, as a some words of encourgemant, it is the person that makes the college, not the other way around. So if your not going to your number 1, 2, or even 10 school, just know that it's up to you
        to make the best out of what your given. And If you really hate it that much, you can always transfer. 1/3 of all students do it at some point, so you'll be in good company.

  <h3>Making the decision</h3>
  <hr>
   <p id="w"> What ever your options are, the vast majority of you have some thinking to do. So here are some tips to make the big decision.
    <ul id='w'>
      <li>
        Just remember, your best option may not be your #1 school. Just think, the financial aid offers should be out so who gave you the most money, what does job recruitment look like post graduation, do they
        have all the support for students that you feel you'd need. Back when you were picking these schools it was easy to go off looks, or feels, but try to be more practical now, and if your mind hasn't changed, all the better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, if you don't like the aid they offered you, reach out to the school. If they accepted you, that means they want you on campus. So just try shooting an email out, be respectful, and tell them that money may be the deciding factor.
        You'd be surprised how willing they might be to fight for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to visit if you can, this seems obvious but if you can actually see the school it may just help you finalize your decision. And if you can't afford to travel, reach out to the school, they may have some programs in place or (if your nice enough)
        may be willing to fly you out. Remember, they wouldn't have accepteted you if they didn't want you on campus.
      </li>
      <li>
        And lastly, talk to some students, Join the "Admitted Students" facebook page if there is one. Try and here what it's actually like to live and learn there from someone who isn't trying to "sell" you the schoolm because those opinions will be the
        most honest.
